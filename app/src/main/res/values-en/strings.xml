Flirt Bingo is a party-flirt game for 2-10 people.\n\n
You just roll the dice and try to find someone you like, with the given attributes.\n\n
Your friends do the same, except for they try to find someone who is NOT your type.\n\n
The person who finds someone fitting and said "Flirt Bingo" first, sets the target.\n\n
If you roll a joker, you can just choose the attribute yourself. Every Player also has universal jokers for all attributes. But these are limited!\n\n
The goal is to get a contact of the person (for example the phone number).\n\n
If you couldn\'t accomplish it, you need to role a punishment over fail.\n\n
!!! The winner gets all drinks from the looser. !!!</string>
